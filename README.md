## 💼 About Me

I'm a highly motivated engineer with hands-on experience in **Cloud Infrastructure**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **Infrastructure Automation**. From managing production-grade services on **AWS ECS** and internal **IPv6-only networks**, to deploying enterprise-grade apps with **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **IIS on Windows Core** — I bridge development and operations with clean, secure, and scalable solutions.

## 📘 What I Work On

- 🛠️ **CI/CD Pipelines** — Robust pipelines with parameterized Jenkinsfiles, dynamic builds, deploy-to-prod toggles, and rollback safety.

- 🧩 **Custom Infra Automation** — Windows Core automation using PowerShell, IIS setup with no UI, application log tracing, and worker process inspection.
- 🧪 **Microservice Deployment** — Build & deploy services like Apache Solr, Milvus via ECS with pre/post-configuration tasks and controlled versioning.
- 🔐 **Secure Access** — Passwordless SSH, secret injection, IAM policy governance for tools like AWS Bedrock and ECR.
- 📦 **Backend Deployment** — Deploy Angular/.NET apps using Docker, Gulp, and IIS, both via Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD.
